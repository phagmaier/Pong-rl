## DESCRIPTION
Attempting to use RL to learn how to play pong against itself. 
 My algo/model uses a simple neural network to act as the reward function estimator


## File Table

| File | Descripton |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| [main.cpp](src/main.cpp) | the visulization of the pong game in c++ using raylib |
| [rl.py](src/rl.py) | will be the NN and how we get a RL model |
| [pong.py](src/pong.py) | a rewrite of my pong game in python |
